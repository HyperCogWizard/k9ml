# Cognitive Engineering Issues Generator

This GitHub Action automatically generates comprehensive GitHub issues for the K9 Cognitive Operating System's engineering roadmap. Each issue represents a major cognitive computing component with detailed implementation specifications, tensor dimensions, and actionable tasks.

## Features

- **Automated Issue Creation**: Generates 10 comprehensive engineering issues
- **Detailed Specifications**: Each issue includes tensor shapes, target files, and technical requirements
- **Actionable Tasks**: Checkbox-based task lists for systematic implementation
- **Proper Labeling**: Issues are categorized with relevant labels for organization
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing issues to avoid duplicates

## Generated Issues

The workflow creates issues for these cognitive OS components:

1. **Attention-Based Cognitive Process Scheduler** - `[n_procs, n_features, t_time]`
2. **Pattern-Aware Memory Management** - `[n_segments, d_pattern, d_hypergraph]`
3. **Hypergraph Processing Engine with Scheme Bindings** - `[n_nodes, n_hyperedges, d_attention, t_evo]`
4. **Neural-Symbolic Integration Layer** - `[n_symbols, d_pattern, d_prob]`
5. **Cognitive Networking Stack** - `[n_nodes, n_routes, d_attention]`
6. **Cognitive Storage and Filesystem** - `[n_files, d_semantics, t_version]`
7. **Device Driver Framework for Cognitive Accelerators** - `[n_devices, d_capabilities, t_usage]`
8. **Cognitive Debugging and Diagnostics Tools** - `[n_patterns, d_attention, t_trace]`
9. **Security and Isolation for Cognitive Processes** - `[n_procs, d_security, t_audit]`
10. **Meta-Cognitive API and Self-Introspection Engine** - `[n_metrics, d_stats, t_live]`

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

To generate the issues manually:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **Generate Cognitive Engineering Issues** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Confirm by clicking **Run workflow** button

### Automatic Trigger

The workflow is scheduled to run once annually on January 1st. This can be disabled by commenting out the `schedule` section in the workflow file.

## Issue Structure

Each generated issue includes:

- **Description**: Overview of the cognitive component
- **Technical Specifications**: Tensor shapes and target files
- **Actionable Tasks**: Detailed checkbox list for implementation
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable goals for completion
- **Labels**: Categorization for project management

## Labels Used

- `enhancement` - All issues are enhancements to the cognitive OS
- `cognitive-core` - Core cognitive functionality (scheduler, memory)
- `cognitive-engine` - Cognitive processing engines
- `neural-symbolic` - Neural-symbolic integration components
- `networking` - Cognitive networking features
- `filesystem` - Cognitive storage and filesystems
- `device-drivers` - Cognitive hardware interfaces
- `debugging` - Debugging and diagnostics tools
- `security` - Security and isolation features
- `meta-cognitive` - Self-introspection and meta-cognitive features
- `high-priority` - Critical components for basic cognitive functionality

## Customization

To modify the generated issues:

1. Edit the `cognitiveIssues` array in `.github/workflows/generate-cognitive-issues.yml`
2. Update titles, descriptions, tasks, or labels as needed
3. Commit changes to trigger the updated workflow

## Requirements

- Repository must have Issues enabled
- Workflow requires `issues: write` permission (automatically granted)
- Uses `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/github-script@v7`

## Architecture Integration

The generated issues are designed to integrate with K9's existing architecture:

- **Port Layer**: Issues target portable kernel components in `port/`
- **Architecture Support**: Tasks include multi-architecture testing (x86, ARM, PowerPC)
- **Plan 9 Compatibility**: Maintains Plan 9 design principles and APIs
- **Cognitive Extensions**: Adds cognitive capabilities without breaking existing functionality

## Development Workflow

1. **Issue Generation**: Run this workflow to create engineering issues
2. **Task Assignment**: Assign issues to team members or milestones
3. **Implementation**: Follow the actionable tasks in each issue
4. **Testing**: Use the success criteria to validate implementations
5. **Integration**: Ensure cognitive features integrate with existing kernel

## Monitoring

The workflow provides console output showing:
- Which issues were created successfully
- Which issues already exist (skipped)
- Any errors encountered during issue creation

This ensures transparency in the issue generation process and helps track the cognitive OS development roadmap.
